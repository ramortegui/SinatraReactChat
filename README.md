# SinatraReactChat
A Sinatra Reactjs Chat
##Description
This app is intended to simulate a chat server.  All the are located in memory.
I use the reactjs definition on: https://github.com/ramortegui/ReactChat
The only difference is the dancer2 app in the backend.  Now I used ruby sinatra.  And all the info has been located in memory. :)
